This is the alternating bit portion of project 2. To run this program,
the user must extract the zip file. They must then access the folder 
through the command shell. When the folder is accessed, the user must
then type in "make", omitting the quotation marks. This will compile
the code and create an executable file called "p2". To run this, the
user must type "./p2", omitting the quotation marks. The user will 
then be prompted with several options to run the simulation along
with the expected inputs. The program then should run to completion.

This program was created in a Linux environment and has been 
successfully tested and run in the environment. No known errors had
arisen during the tests.
