This is the Go-Back-N portion of project 2. To run this program,
the user must extract the zip file. They must then access the folder 
through the command shell. When the folder is accessed, the user must
then type in "make", omitting the quotation marks. This will compile
the code and create an executable file called "p2". To run this, the
user must type "./p2", omitting the quotation marks. The user will 
then be prompted with several options to run the simulation along
with the expected inputs. The program then should run to completion.

This program was created in a Linux environment and has been 
successfully tested and run in the environment. When testing this 
program, the only error I came across was an issue with enabling the
randomizing actions, where some of the times the program will not 
run through to completion. The only work around I found to this issue
is to kill the process (ctl+c) and try the same inputs again until it
actually runs to completion.
