README.txt - Danny Sullivan - djsullivan

This program is meant to be run through the command shell. The user
should navigate through the command shell to where the folder of this
project is located. Once there, the user must type in "make", omitting
the quotation marks, in order to create the executable. This will
create the executabble "p3". The user runs this program by typing in
"./p3", omitting the quotation marks. The user will then be prompted
with a tracing level in which they would like to use for the program,
which should be answered with a number. Optionally, when originally
running the program, the user can also put the tracing level in 
after typing "./p3", for example "./p3 1", omitting the quotation
marks. The program will then print out the shortest distance between
nodes, as well as the process it goes through to figure out the
shortest distance through printing out updated tables for each node.
When the user is finished, they can delete the executable by typing
in "make clean", omitting the quotation marks.
